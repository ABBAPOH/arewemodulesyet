      This website tracks the most popular C++ libraries, compilers, and build systems. We use vcpkg to get a rough idea of how popular a library is based on how many revisions the port has.

      We also have an example section to track good projects using modules natively and a document section tracks good articles about modules too.

      Feel free to contribute to these lists.
